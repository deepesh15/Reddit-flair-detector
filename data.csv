incorrect tax information means money cant collected invoice gst would one wrong tax number could one two twenty mistakes happen real life one common things face mistakes happened gst well happen

might registered office 2 states example ie wont gst number provide declaration pepperfry saying dont gst number two states pepperfry able give invoice payment money delayed till getting declaration experience takes long time tata motors says arent able claim input tax credit state thats like leaving money table getting declaration basically saying willing lose money transaction requires approvals upto highest levels loss company manoj follow two time consuming things get amount money thus efficiency goes 2 cash flow cash lifeline company company without cash cannot survive could valued billion dollars dont cash pay employees shut kingfisher couldnt pay employees interest vendors didnt cash left jet doesnt cash payment salaries fuel loan payments etc bsnl struggling pay things dont cashthus healthy cash flow one important aspects business survival company companies people cash flow would oxygen invoicing cash brought companybecause decrease efficiency collection managers delay introduced collection cash pregst cash collected 25 days would taking say 45 days collection managers efficiency gone downand tiny delays add incorrect gst add another 7 days cash collected missing gst add 15 days etcthis two outcomesfirstly pepperfry earlier predicted theyll get money 30 days receiving 45 days means 70 lakhs need 30th day daily expenses needs found somewhere else since 70 days coming another 2 weeks dip reserves 15 dayssecondly money lost value 70 lakhs end 30 days since time passed lost value due time value money couldve generated interest couldve invested delayed hence value lost loss pepperfryto summarize gst delayed payment cycle company takes longer collect amount money used gst introduced money takes longer come takes longer go salaries interest payments vendor payments outflows impacted 3 profit profit made deal varies company company deal deal let us assume pepperfry made 10 profit deal ie 7 lakhs due following factors profit get impacteda payment cycle delayed theyre collecting profit longer duration collect 63 lakhs start making profit could say theyve collected 13 20 invoices remaining 7 give profit basically profit generation delayed cash flow delayed means profit made deal lost value pregst 7 lakhs itll less 7 lakhs value due time value money efficiency gone effort required generate amount profit gone thus profit deal actually gone downb 20 invoices process always go many get stuck payment delayed may never come due process issues money linger never come pepperfry become bad debt invoice gets stuck reason like incorrect gst missing gst incorrect value cash wont collected invoice amount get reduced profit invoice hasnt gotten processed 7 lakhs profit less say 5 lakhs 7 lakhs collected deal pepperfry actually make loss dealthe biggest culprits psus like hpcl bpcl ubi etc requirements stringent single mistake hold invoice payment could get delayed years thus profit deal impacted wont pay till everything invoice correct could delay multiple reasons many businesses dont sell psus reason profits cash get stuck business themthis different pregst earlier say mistake one invoice fix could many amount revenue chances wont make amount profitthus due lowered efficiency longer payment cycle stuck payments profit made gotten impactedin conclusion ramblings due statespecific nature gst effort required make

inr 10 lakhsinstallation inr 1 lakhsupport inr 3 lakhsthe total money collected sales executive manoj procurement guy finance guy 20 times work added valuetheir efficiency scenario gone 5 arguably go 27 states union territories involved although rare casealso like said ideal scenario doesnt always go smoothly challenges encountered area incorrect proportions purchase orders invoices someone made mistake 10 needed allocated theyve allocated 11 15 process repeated finding faultb incorrect gst po invoice suppose particular invoice wrong gst means cant processed incorrect tax information means money cant collected invoice gst would one wrong tax number could one two twenty mistakes happen real life one common things face mistakes happened gst well happen multiples really cant expect people make mistakes always efficiency goes multiple times effort required fix mistakesc missing gst isnt necessary companies gst registration every state tata motors might registered office 2 states example ie wont gst number provide declaration pepperfry saying dont gst number two states pepperfry able give invoice payment money delayed till getting declaration experience takes long time tata motors says arent able claim input tax credit state thats like leaving money table getting declaration basically saying willing lose money transaction requires approvals upto highest levels loss company manoj follow two time consuming things get amount money thus efficiency goes 2 cash flow cash lifeline company company without cash cannot survive could valued billion dollars dont cash pay employees shut kingfisher couldnt pay employees interest vendors didnt cash left jet doesnt cash payment salaries fuel loan payments etc bsnl struggling pay things dont cashthus healthy cash flow one important aspects business survival company companies people cash flow would oxygen invoicing cash brought companybecause decrease efficiency collection managers delay introduced collection cash pregst cash collected 25 days would taking say 45 days collection managers efficiency gone downand tiny delays add incorrect gst add another 7 days cash collected missing gst add 15 days etcthis two outcomesfirstly pepperfry earlier predicted theyll get money 30 days receiving 45 days means 70 lakhs need 30th day daily expenses needs found somewhere else since 70 days coming another 2 weeks dip reserves 15 dayssecondly money lost value 70 lakhs end 30 days since time passed lost value due time value money couldve generated interest couldve invested delayed hence value lost loss pepperfryto summarize gst delayed payment cycle company takes longer collect amount money used gst introduced money takes longer come takes longer go salaries interest payments vendor payments outflows impacted 3 profit profit made deal varies company company deal deal let us assume pepperfry made 10 profit deal ie 7 lakhs due following factors profit get impacteda payment cycle delayed theyre collecting profit longer duration collect 63 lakhs start making profit could say theyve collected 13 20 invoices remaining 7 give profit basically profit generation delayed cash flow delayed means profit made deal lost value pregst 7 lakhs itll less 7 lakhs value due time value money efficiency gone effort required generate amount profit gone thus profit deal actually gone downb 20 invoices process always go many get stuck payment delayed may never come due process issues money linger never come pepperfry become bad debt invoice gets stuck reason like incorrect gst missing gst incorrect value cash wont collected invoice amount get reduced profit invoice hasnt gotten processed 7 lakhs profit less say 5 lakhs 7 lakhs collected deal pepperfry actually make loss dealthe biggest culprits psus like hpcl bpcl ubi etc requirements stringent single mistake hold invoice payment could get delayed years thus profit deal impacted wont pay till everything invoice correct could delay multiple reasons many businesses dont sell psus reason profits cash get stuck business themthis different pregst earlier say mistake one invoice fix could many amount revenue chances wont make amount profitthus due lowered efficiency longer payment cycle stuck payments profit made gotten impactedin conclusion ramblings due statespecific nature gst effort required make amount money pregst era gone impacted revenue thus profit made companies problems everyone face gst want business multiple states ready face challengesfeel free discuss impact economy opinion big impact really need someone much knowledgeable analyze publish feel deserves conversation least one change impacted revenue profit extensively made making money harder thus going lasting impact economy worst part doesnt look like system going change near futureill probably put tl dr later
